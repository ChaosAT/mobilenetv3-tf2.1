# mobilenetv3-tf2.1
A tf2.1 implementation of google's mobilenetv3-small with pretrain weights.  

  Rewrite xiaolai-sqlai's mbv3-small with tf2.1.  
  
  You can get more information in https://github.com/xiaolai-sqlai/mobilenetv3  
  
  There are many differences between this implementation and the network architecture   described in the original paper Searching for MobileNetV3, 
like in SE module use conv2d not dense to do S and E.
